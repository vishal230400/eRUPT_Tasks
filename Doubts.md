# Task 2:
## Subtask 3:
- I am not able to use FDB as storage backend for janusgraph. I am not able to find correct resource on the internet as well.

# Task 3:
## Subtask 1:
- I am not able to install FDB using its source code, it always shows up with errors and issues.

# Questions:
- Anamoly in some experiments why is that?
- Java loading time seems to be too much compared to C
- Trends seems to be different in Java and C for few modes
- Eventhough chunk size could be found in FDB github, still when I ran and check, I found it not to be exact to the number specified (Number was found from a thread in foundationdb forum by Hieu). ( They make have implemented some internal algorithm )
